it is CI/CD tool which it is available on the internet that means it is open source written in java 

CONTINUES INTEGRATION : build + test
advantage's: before time is wasting and manual work is high 

DEPLOYMENT: the process of installing web application into the server

CONTINUES DELIVERY:  if the deployment  to the production  is manual then it is called continues delivery
CONTINUES DEPLOYMENT : if the deployment to the production is automated then it is called continues deployment
ex: here if you change the code anything in source then it will trigger and it will automatically tested ,build and deploy on the production.

PIPELINE: step by step execution of the process is called pipeline.
                       or
          series of events are interlink at each other is called pipeline

UAT(USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING)
PROD
QA
DEV->QA->UAT->PROD
developer->testers->client->end-user

plugin: small software which is automates our small work or manual work

CI/CD: whenever a developer write code , we integrate all the code at the developer at any point in the time and we build ,test and delivery/deploy it to client.

ADVANATAGES:
* master-slave architecture 
* write your own plugin ,can use the community plugin
* easy to understand what process going on


	*********JENKINS SETUP********
STEP1: getting Jenkins repo from the Jenkins.io
STEP2: installing java11(java11 or 17) because it supports only that version 
       java --version
STEP3: installing git, maven, Jenkins
       yum install git ,maven ,Jenkins -y
STEP4: restarting Jenkins
    
NOTE: whenever you download any service on the Linux by defautly it will be on the stopped state.
    systemctl restart Jenkins.service

STEP5: connecting to Jenkins dashboard using IP or DNS of aws ec2 instance 

NOTE:  Jenkins default port is 8080


TROUBLESHOOT PART:
if face anything error then check in security group is 8080 are there or not
check the the service is running or not in server(ec2)
check the java version



Jenkins.sh

sudo yum update â€“y

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

sudo yum upgrade

sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y


sudo yum install jenkins -y


sudo systemctl enable jenkins
 
sudo systemctl start jenkins

sudo systemctl status Jenkins

*** CUSTOM WORKSPACE***:
----
mkdir -p tcs/jenkinsbuilds
cd /
chown jenkins:jenkins /root/ -R

execute commands
build steps  --. execute shell

 

	JENKINS ENVINORMENT VARIABLES****
--------------------  ------------ 
these variables are defined by the Jenkins defaultLy.

variable types:
1. user defined variables:
   a. Local variables : which works inside the job only and case sensitive 
   b. global variables : works any where
2. Jenkins environment variables



NOTE:  user defined variables are not work for some properties of Jenkins 

*** Jenkins environment variables are going to change for every build

note: 
users will not define java environment variable 

Jenkins email: when trigger pipeline it will trigger mail to team.once it is finished.

PARAMETERS:
in Jenkins lot of the parameters used to acknowledge.

use of the parameters /:- to acknowledge build is build by the extract information 

types of the parameters:
---  ---
1. choice parameters : to give list of parameters
2. string parameters : when you want pass variable directly (you have choice to enter values whatever you want)

NOTE: IN choice parameters need to define input values but in string parameter is no need to give values

3. multi string : string pass one line but multi string pass multiple lines
4. file parameter : if you want use local computer files then use this parameters
5. Boolean parameters (TRUE OR FALASE): it is used for you using the db or not need to contribution in that pipeline.

THROTTLE BUILD: to restrict the number of builds in a job.

BUILD TRIGGERS:

trigger builds remotely (ex;from scripts)
jenkinsurl/job/jobname/...=authentication token
example:
http://3.81.61.47:8080/job/job1//build?token=abc


LINKED JOBS:  jobs are linked with each other jobs 
types of : UPSTREAM JOBS 
           DOWN STREAM JOBS 



PASWWORDLESS LOGIN FOR JENKINS:
====

cd /var/lib/Jenkins 
vim config.xml
go to line 7 change to false then you will easily login without password for you Jenkins.


PIPELINE AS CODE:  all commands in single line.

PIPLINE: sequence of all commands which is run in Linux are placed at one files executed one by one is called pipeline 

or 

pipeline is combination of the plugins that supports integration and implementation of continues delivery pipelines .

pipeline is a group of event with inter linked with each other.

TYPES OF PIPELINES:
1. DECLARTIVE and  2.SCRIPTED PIPELINES

DECLARTIVE PIPELINE: which the syntax took long steps is called declarative mean which is the steps easily understood.
syntax:

pipeline {
   any agent
     stages{
      stage("hello"){
        steps{
           sh 'touch file1'
 }
}
}
}

SCRIPTED PIPELINE: which is the syntax took short steps is called scripted which mean it took time or difficult to understand the steps to beginner.
syntax:

node {
   stage("stage1"){
       echo "hello"
}


# in the pipeline we have choice to  pass the parameters 

parameters{
  string(name: passion, defaultvalue:prasad',description:"baagunava")
  choice("      "        "         "  "            " )


above one is not come with the first job build it will came after the first build



INTEGRATE GIT WITH JENKINS:
------ ---------- -------
pipeline{
   any agent
     stages {
        stage ("checkout") {
          steps{
            'git url.com'
           }
        stage ("complie"){
          steps{
            sh 'lscpu'
        }
     }
  }



input parameters:it will hold the pipeline because they will check the parameters 


MASTER & SLAVES :
---- ---- ----
to distribute the work load
LABELS:  to assign the work particular slave
USES: 
Schedule the jobs 
store the builds 
send the build to slave server


SETUP SLAVE:
1.create a server an install java-11
2. configure agent
dashboard-manage jenkins-nodes-newnode
3. number of executors : 3 remote root directory:/tmp
lables: prod 
hostname:private-ip of slave
crendentials - sshusername with privatekey : pem file 
hostkey verification stategy: non verify
online agent as much as possible

* restrict where this project execute give label (here) prod

NOTE: when the master node is offline check the diskspace (to remove files and foldrs in the path  var/lib/jenkin/workspaceor /tmp )and make space for them  after click on the back to node online


postbuild:
---------
action that happens after the build

always: 
-----
when the build is success or falure

success:
-----
if the build succesfull

failure:

if the build failure
-----


cd /var/lib/Jenkins/workspaces


RABC: ROLE BASE ACCESS CONTROL:
-------------------------
dowanooad - rbabc plugin in Jenkins 

*** if we will give the access of resource with role based access by assuming roles to users.

*PIPELINE BUILDING:
------
JOB views:
to separate the free style jobs and pipeline types.

&&&&IMP concepts &&&&&:
---------  ---------
*CRON JOB:
TO schedule the work 
cron sysntax : * * * * *(mintues hours date month dayoftheweek) 

* the source code is not changed

*POLL SCM: 
 to solve cronjob error(disadvantage)
it will trigger the build when the source code changes anything

*WEBHOOKS:
 it will trigger  the build immediately  not like poll scm

* permalinks:
it will show the configuration of the Jenkins builds
